I was studying law in Delhi when I got involved in highlighting the Malnutrition deaths of children in Nabarangpur district in 2002. I had gone back to my district. Before joining in active politics I had established an organisation named as Garib Sena whose soul aim was to expose the corruption in terms of all benefits which are meant for common deprived people at the village level. During that period I conducted massive agitation in Gram Panchayat levels and Block levels on mismanagement of welfare schemes which were meant for rural people like rice and Kerosene.
