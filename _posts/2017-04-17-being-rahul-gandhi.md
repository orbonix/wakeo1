Being Rahul Gandhi is hard and rarely he gets any appreciations for functioning in one of the hardest job in Indian politics today. Though the media will try to make you believe that he has not been doing well, because media has a position bias and they tend to take extreme ends just in the completion to fetch eye balls for their advertisers. Post Godhra Modi according to media could do nothing right because thats what channels thought people wanted to hear and they all competed to deliver that, post nuclear tests Vajpayee could do nothing right because thats what a proud nation wanted to hear and our good servant media delivered that. Fact is in the recently concluded assembly elections our of 5 congress has actually won 3 of them. UP was a big loss but within the loss was a masterstroke of tying up with SP which none other than RG could take a call on, and the failure was more because of SP fighting its was in public right before elections and leaving Mayawati out of the coalition. So if at all there was a failure it was not in RG pushing for a coalition but in not pushing even more vehemently for one of which Mayawati Ji was also a part. And after the present assembly result I can put all my money on Congress, SP Akhilesh & Mayawati all coming together in a coalition to fight General Elections and decimate BJP. Hence, this assembly elections UP and appointment of love jehad Yogi a blessing in disguise for the General Elections two years away.

With Punjab RGs decision making was all the way emphatic, with the clear declaration of a CM candidate before elections could throw the Sikh face of Congress into the election fray where it was directly fighting with AAP, who was making opportune use of sikh symbolism to cut into Alkalis base. But were had convert plans to put punjab on Delhi CMs control a idea which most Punjabiâ€™s wont espouse a lot. Apart from it taking chance on significant number of young fresh faces as candidates in the punjab poll also switched the swing in favor of Congress enough to gather majority. What happened in Manipur and Goa has no parallels in hijacking the public mandate of state by the centers rule through Governors, and inspite of such grand murder of democracy and backing of people if Congress had taken aggressive stand the peace fabric of those states would be our of order. So congress has people on their side and the fragile arrangements that have fit in over there will have their own death within a couple of years just in time for us to take advantage in General Elections. The elected MLAs had to sacrifice a lot to be part of this design and for that they should be commended.

RG is a very educated and thoughtful leader who has lot of patience and will to swim against the stream. Having been a close friend and confidante I have seen his struggles and his honesty into issues that he cares about. He has contributed towards changing the congress party for its progressive future, when regressive nationalism and fundamentalism is the order of the day. Being Rahul Gandhi is hard , stressful but on the path he is on will be successful.A man hold to such high standards where he is only criticized for his failures and never appreciated for successes, can only win in life never loose. I wish him all luck and great health.
