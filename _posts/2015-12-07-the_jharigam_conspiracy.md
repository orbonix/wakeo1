   You must be reading and hearing of some of the drama thats going on in Jhrigam and wondering whats actually going on there, Jharigam is a small block in Nabrangpur so many of you may not care about whats going on there but some of the events that are taking place over here would be of interest to all of you because it exposes the dirty mind of our honorable and respected Chief Minister Biju Sabaka Shri Naveen Patnaik. I am not a big fan of his policies and style of politics and that  would be very clear from my activities and views in the past. Earlier I was a MP and hence had to divide my time between my constituency, the state and Delhi. But since I am no longer a member of parliament I have been spending most of my time in undivided Koraput, meeting people and trying to be part of the solution to their problems. I have overseen and monitored lot of developmental work, have done major work in ensuring true beneficiaries are enrolled to get advantage of various government projects but because there is rampant corruption in Naveen Sarkar at all levels trying to weed out corruption and being a voice and force against the corrupt Naveen Patnaik across the state has been a majority of my activities. I have taken up keen interest in empowerment of my community the Adivasi community have travelled across the state and have setup strong grass root organizations in 13 districts of Odisha. I am working to raise the rights of Adivasis in various platforms and holding Naveen Patnaik accountable for his anti Adivasi policies. And hence I have been on his target since quite sometime, during the 2014 general elections from various quarters he had sent emissaries and feelers to join hands with BJD, I know he has no vision in politics and had no interest in licking his boots for rest of my life so I never entertained. But since the election is over there have been many attempts to put me in trouble. And now he has unleashed a new trick from his bag, and this one happens to be a very stinky dirty one.

Since last 25 years Jharigam block in Nabrangpur is with Congress, the great Shri Habibullah Khan had created a very nice base for congress in this block that Congress like us have only inherited and nurtured. We have worked day and night for people, fought against corruption, made sure the benefits meant for people do reach them. And hence even in very bad times the public of Jharigam have been with us. And a strong foot in Jharigam and Nabrangour has given me the confidence and base to run my campaign against the corrupt and comatose Naveen Patnaik. And now he is targeting that to weaken me and keep me engaged in local politics. And this time he is firing the shots by keeping the gun on one of my Adivasi brother Shri Ramesh Majhi. Few days ago 23 members of Jharigam blok committee were instigated under pressure to bring forward a no confidence motion against the sitting Block chairman Shri Prassana Majhi ( congress worker , my brother too ). When met and comforted about their and their family’s security 18 of them went back and gave a letter expressing to withdraw the no confidence motion. But the BDO wanted to go for a vote due to some external pressure. And now before the voting is to happen BJD goons have abducted about 12 committee members, transported some to Vizag and a few to Bhubaneswar. The families of 4 already have filed FIRs with Police and we organized a protest in Jharigam to apply pressure on police to track the abducted members. One of them was found in the residence of Shri Ramesh Majhi, and the I have his phone recording where he told me that he was made to talk to media and say that he has come for some work not been abducted.

We will keep on mounting pressure and continue our efforts to track our people whom BJD goons have abducted. And we are also confident that we will get support from some BJD members and the congress block president will win the vote of confidence. Adivasi hater Naveen Patnaik’s plan will bite dust and fail, and we will ensure that we will everyone in Jharigam aware of why this kind of a dirty game was being played just before 8 months of Panchayat elections. If they had the strength to win the block they will have their chance to do it in just few months, but with a plan to keep me engaged in local politics and sabotage my idea of Unified Tribal Identity a movement that I am working on across Odisha.
