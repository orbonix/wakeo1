It was 10th September 2015, a day unusually hot and there was lot of activity in a rural farmer's pocket in Bolangir. The highway was packed with people about 10000 of them were there, who accompanied Rahul Ji on a 9km long padyatra attracting attention to the plight of the farmers due to crop loss. But then there was this one man who could have easily enjoyed a nice siesta at his home. But was accompanying Rahul Ji on the walk on his wheel chair, he was Jeetendra Biswal. His a life is a story that will be told many times over and here you hear and get inspired from him.
