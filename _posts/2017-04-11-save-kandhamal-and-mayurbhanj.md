More burning shops + more burning houses  = More votes for BJP so its clear who started the Bhadrakh danga, stage managed it and continued to a point of arson and carnage that it brought with it. I am yet to travel to Bhadrakh and hence exactly don’t know how people of Bhadrakh have responded to this sense of insecurity but what I am seeing on social media since couple of days has frightened me. People sitting in plush offices in Bangalore who have been active on Facebook long before any kid in Bhadrakh would have been don’t know about the block and ban censorship features of Facebook and are advocating immediate arrest of people on the basis of Facebook comments, especially a comment that no one has seen themselves. When the brightest of our youths are retreating their steps from progressiveness nd the bot on their smartphones may be a little bit more empathetic and reasonable than their actual self. We have reason to worry as a nation. Because India’s claim to future glory is in its youth and if the youth finds it fashionable to be regressive we are essentially sowing the seeds of a alternate kind of ISIS mentality. I am sure none of us want that, so against all odds even if we are ridiculed and laughed at now is the time to canvass and reiterate our principles of inclusiveness, tolerance and belief in human values which have kept us together as a nation since thousands of years.

Its no secret any more that with the kind of positive response BJP goondas have got with Bhadrakh danga, they are gonna make all attempts to spread it to other parts of Odisha. I am assuming Kandhamal and Mayurbhanj to be their next targets as VHP has been pumping activists into these places since December. And lot of funding is being provided to conduct grandiose militant religious processions where often not a single local resident is seen. All signs of Modi Model of firing up communal tension in 3D model deploy,destroy and display. The militants who have been brought in from outside Odisha often from Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand are part of their design to attack and vanish, the kind they deployed in Bhadrakh. And after we know of their plan of destruction of poor peoples property will be a huge failure of the government but even more grander failure for us driven by Gandhian principles of peace and tolerance. Not acting proactively against violence and letting it thrive to create incidents like Bhadrakh is a greater act of violence than sorting these imported out of state BJP militants. So friends who believe in the inclusive fabric of Odisha where everybody gives everybody lives to create a better future for all. If you come across non Odia speaking saffron clad operatives in towns of Kandhamal and Mayurbhanj, interrogate them try to find out their whereabouts and intention of being in Odisha, if you feel they may be communal militants ask them to go out of Odisha and spread violence else where. Not here in the land of Jagannath and Buddha.
