Dear Prime Minister Modi,

I extend my congratulations to you on your appointment to me as migrant-city-labour from native-place-based happy labour. I had a great expectation from you. Today, my disappointment forced to write a letter to you. I am an ordinary citizen of the country. After seven year of happy life, now, I am bound migrate from my village in order to search for livelihood.


Congress government’s rural safety program MGNREGA, where we worked with much enthusiasm comes to an end, because you reduced allocation for this scheme, and also there is no alternate of it. It was life line for poor like us. Though it has not removed our poverty, but it helps to fill the hungry stomachs. You run miles in the morning for losing fat from body, at the same time we also run miles in the morning in the search of food for two times. The drought like situation in the state brings turbulent economic condition. The worrisome at large. You gave a deadly blow to our income and purchasing power. Although there are serious loop holes like huge delays in wage payments, poor quality of accessing work, but nothing is better than something. Instead of transformational changes in the scheme, you are silently trying abolish it.

While whole India celebrated Diwali, my family members’ tears are falling continuously since I left home, though they attempted to hide fill up eyes to me, but I can experience it. You have been travelling to abroad since you became Prime Minister, I don’t know what I will get from it, but for me, there is God, where food is. So I decided to migrate in the search of food. I don’t know what is my future?

Finally sir , I want to say something. You have said that Hindus and Muslims must decide what they want to fight, each other or poverty. To me this is nothing but another empty slogan because poverty is inextricably connected to religion, caste and class. For vote you politicians can do anything. Unless we face up to these challenges with greater honesty and courage, not just our poverty but our backwardness will remain indeed incurable. But it will not going to happen because enslavement is our religion.  Nothing… poor men have nothing… rich men need nothing…nothing is more evil than the devil… and nothing is greater than God… but if you eat nothing, you’ll die (eventually)… I am not frustrated; hope one day better days will come.

With kind regards,

An Indian (Not a Hindu, Muslim or etc).
